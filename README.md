# Team-Velcro

Overview:

Given the teamâ€™s areas of expertise (mechanical engineering, CAD, 3D printing, ID, coding), we decided to focus on optimizing the physical and mechanical design of Cyan rather than improving its efficiency from a chemistry standpoint.

Considering the current Cyan design, we identified the following as potential areas of improvement:
*Frequent hands-on servicing
*Limited capacity of hydrated lime
*Tedious removal of saturated CaCO3

Here is some of our design sketches and concept art:
